## Introductions

Please introduce yourself briefly, we don't have a lot of time for this part. Please tell me:

- Name you prefer to be called in class if different from the one listed on the class list
- Your area of professions focus (developer, SRE, tester, BA, hardware engineer, etc.)
- Any experience you have with DevOps or similar products, including Chili Project.
- Any specific objectives for the class or specific items you want to learn.


## About the class

Because we have a lot of topics to cover in a short period of time, there will be no hands-on labs during the class.

Instead, the class will consist of some presentation and a lot of demos to illustrate the main points.

There is lab document that essentially describes the demos so that you can try them out for yourself after the class. The document is specifically focussed on how to set up a practice environment.
